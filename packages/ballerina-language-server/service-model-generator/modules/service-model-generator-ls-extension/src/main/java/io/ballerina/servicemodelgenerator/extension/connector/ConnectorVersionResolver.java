     *       A keyed lookup, and reading it costs nothing but a parsed manifest.</li>
     *   <li><b>{@code Ballerina.toml}'s {@code [[dependency]]}</b> — the user's explicit pin. This has
     *       to be consulted before the graph, because the graph cannot be trusted to reflect it: the
     *       language server resolves <b>offline</b> by default
     *       ({@code CommonUtil.COMPILE_OFFLINE} defaults to {@code true}), so when the pinned version
     *       is not in the local bala cache, resolution silently substitutes the newest version that
     *       <i>is</i> cached and the graph reports that instead — the exact case of a project pinned to
     *       an older release that has never been built.</li>
     *   <li><b>The resolved dependency graph</b> — the in-memory truth when nothing is pinned or
     *       locked (there, a substitution genuinely is what the compiler will use). Its API exposes
     *       nodes as a plain collection, so it has to be scanned, and reaching it forces resolution.
     *       Hence last.</li>
