/**
 * The single ordered list of components, and the one place a future spec version diverges: registering a
 * replacement resolver here is the whole change, because nothing else names a component.
 *
 * <p><b>Ordering.</b> Within a tier the order is declared once, here. Only three entries have a reason to
 * sit where they do, and each is noted at its line; the rest are order-independent. Handler-tier order in
 * particular carries no meaning at all: {@link HandlerDraft} holds each slot as a field and emits the wire
 * contract's key order itself, so a component can be inserted anywhere without changing the JSON.
 *
 * <p><b>Lifetime.</b> A registry is built per library load, never shared: {@link ListenerAspect} memoizes
 * the listener object it builds, and that cache is only valid within one library's resolved package.
 *
 * @since 1.7.0
