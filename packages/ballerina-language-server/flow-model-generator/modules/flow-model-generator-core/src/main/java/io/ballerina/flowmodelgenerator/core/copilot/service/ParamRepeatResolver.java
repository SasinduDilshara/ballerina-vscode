/**
 * Owns <b>spec §7 {@code params[].addMode}</b>: whether a parameter slot repeats.
 *
 * <p>Spec §7 defines exactly one value — {@code "many"}, meaning the slot "repeats zero or more times,
 * each occurrence independently named/typed (HTTP query/header, MCP tool args)" — and "Absent = at most
 * one".
 *
 * <p><b>This replaces {@code ParamTypeResolver.isRepeatable}</b>, which owned the same key while
 * {@code ParamTypeResolver} otherwise owns {@code type}/{@code presence}/{@code name}. Two owners for one
 * key is exactly what the one-construct-one-owner rule forbids, and the split matters here because the
 * renderer treats the two modifiers completely differently: {@code presence} keeps a slot in the signature
 * and adds a note, whereas {@code addMode} takes it <i>out</i> of the signature altogether.
 *
 * <p><b>A repeatable slot is not a parameter.</b> Before this component
 * {@code HandlerCatalogAspect.buildOptionParams} skipped such a slot outright, so everything the document
 * said about it — its legal types, its {@code @http:Header} annotation — reached the prompt nowhere. But
 * emitting it as a parameter would be worse than skipping it: the document states no name (the author
 * picks one per occurrence), so a generated {@code anydata param2} would be an invented parameter in a
 * signature meant to be copied. The slot is therefore carried to the wire, marked, and rendered as a note
 * rather than as syntax.
 *
