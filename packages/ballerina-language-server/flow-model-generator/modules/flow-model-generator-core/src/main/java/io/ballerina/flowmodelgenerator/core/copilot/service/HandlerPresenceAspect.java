/**
 * Spec §5 {@code options[].presence} — whether a handler must be implemented or may be omitted.
 *
 * <p>Applies to a metadata-driven handler only. A <b>concrete</b> service type's methods are read from the
 * semantic model, where no such notion exists: the type declares them and the compiler plugin decides which
 * a service must implement, so the document says nothing and neither does this component. That is why
 * {@code trigger.github}'s and {@code mcp:AdvancedService}'s handlers carry no presence marker.
