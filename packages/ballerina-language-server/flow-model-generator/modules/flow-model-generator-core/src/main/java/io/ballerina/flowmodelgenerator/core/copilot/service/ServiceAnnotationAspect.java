/**
 * Spec §8 {@code annotations[]} at {@code attachPoint: "service"} — the annotations the generated service
 * must or may carry.
 *
 * <p>Carried on the <b>service</b> rather than hoisted to the library, and deliberately distinct from the
 * library's own {@code annotations} list: that list states which annotations the library <i>declares</i>
 * (a fact the compiler reports), whereas these state which ones <i>this service type is obliged to
 * attach</i> — the obligation, its presence, and its scope, none of which any symbol carries. Before this
 * component, a required annotation reached the prompt only as an available declaration among dozens, with
 * nothing marking it as mandatory for the service being written.
 *
 * <p><b>Known coverage gap, by design elsewhere.</b> Two of the corpus's eleven service-level
 * annotations never reach a prompt, and not because of anything this component does:
 * {@code ballerina/http} and {@code ballerina/graphql} both declare an optional {@code serviceConfig},
 * and both have a curated {@code generic-services.json} entry whose name collides with their service
 * type — so {@code ServiceLoader.mergeWithGenericServices} discards this component's whole entry in
 * favour of the hand-written instructions. That overlay is richer than anything synthesized here and
 * must keep winning, but the consequence is a silent drop: it happens after the pipeline, so it raises
 * no {@link Veto} and logs nothing. Both are {@code optional}, so nothing miscompiles. Making the drop
 * reportable belongs to the validator phase, which owns cross-cutting document diagnostics — it cannot
 * be done here without this component reaching into the merge step it knows nothing about.
 *
 * @since 1.7.0
