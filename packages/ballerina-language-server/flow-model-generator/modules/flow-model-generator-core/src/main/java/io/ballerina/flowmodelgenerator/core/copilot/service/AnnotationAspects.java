/**
 * Spec §8 {@code annotations[]} at all four attach points: which annotations generated code must or may
 * carry, on the service, on a handler, on a handler parameter, and on a handler's return.
 *
 * <p>The four differ only in where the id list is read from, which {@link AnnotationScopeResolver.Scope}
 * they select with, and which draft slot they write to; selection itself is one by-id lookup shared by all
 * of them. They are grouped here rather than split across eight files for that reason.
 *
 * <p><b>What §8 adds over the library's own annotation list.</b> That list states which annotations a
 * library <i>declares</i> — a fact the compiler reports. These state which ones a construct is <i>obliged
 * to attach</i>: the obligation, its presence and its scope, none of which any symbol carries. Before this,
 * a required annotation reached the prompt only as one available declaration among dozens.
 *
 * <p><b>Rejections {@code drop}, they do not {@code veto}.</b> An unresolvable obligation makes the
 * obligation unusable, not the construct carrying it.
 *
 * <p><b>Known coverage gap, owned elsewhere.</b> {@code ballerina/http} and {@code ballerina/graphql} both
 * declare an optional service-level {@code serviceConfig} and both have a curated
 * {@code generic-services.json} entry whose name collides with their service type, so
 * {@code ServiceLoader.mergeWithGenericServices} discards the synthesized entry in favour of the
 * hand-written instructions. That overlay is richer and must keep winning, but the drop happens after this
 * pipeline: it raises no {@link Veto} and logs nothing. Both are {@code optional}, so nothing miscompiles.
