/**
 * Spec §3's {@code multiple*Allowed} pair — and the decision of which half of it is worth saying.
 *
 * <h2>Only a prohibition is emitted</h2>
 *
 * <p>Both keys are set on all 26 service types in the corpus, so writing both unconditionally would land a
 * note on essentially every trigger service the Copilot renders. Only the {@code false} values earn that
 * space:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code true} grants a permission a generator would not exercise unprompted. The default shape a
 *       model writes — one service, one listener — is legal under {@code true} <i>and</i> under
 *       {@code false}, so stating {@code true} changes no output it would otherwise produce.</li>
 *   <li>{@code false} forbids something a model can plausibly reach for. Asked to consume two Kafka
 *       topics, the obvious shape is two services on one listener, which {@code kafka}'s
 *       {@code multipleServicesAllowed: false} makes illegal. That is the case where saying
 *       nothing costs a compile.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This is the same asymmetry the pipeline already applies elsewhere: {@link HandlerPresenceResolver}
 * emits nothing when the document is not answering the question, and {@link IdentifierResolver} yields a
 * placeholder only for a slot that must be filled. Across the whole corpus this rule emits <b>three</b>
 * lines — {@code kafka} (both) and {@code ballerinax/trigger.google.calendar} (the second) — instead of
 * twenty-four.
 *
 * <p>The two keys are written <b>separately</b> rather than merged into one note: they answer different
 * questions, and {@code kafka} is the only service type in the corpus where both fire, so a combined line
 * would be wrong for {@code trigger.google.calendar}.
 *
