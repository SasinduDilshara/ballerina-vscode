/**
 * Spec §5 {@code options[].kind} and the accessor of a resource handler.
 *
 * <p>Owns the two facts the renderer's keyword choice needs: whether to write {@code remote function} or
 * {@code resource function}, and — for the latter — which accessor follows it. Taken out of
 * {@link HandlerIdentityAspect}, which now owns only the handler's name and description, so that a change to
 * how a resource handler is written cannot perturb how it is named.
 *
 * <p>The accessor is emitted only for a resource handler. For a remote one it would be meaningless, and
 * {@code graphql}'s mutation shows why that matters: it carries GraphQL field metadata while being
 * {@code kind: "remote"}, so an accessor resolved from its siblings' vocabulary must not leak onto it.
