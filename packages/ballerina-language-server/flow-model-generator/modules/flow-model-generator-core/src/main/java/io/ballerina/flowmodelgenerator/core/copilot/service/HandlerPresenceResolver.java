/**
 * Owns <b>spec §5 {@code options[].presence}</b>: whether a handler must be implemented or may be omitted.
 *
 * <p>Spec §5 scopes the field precisely — "{@code presence} | Only under {@code addMode: subset}" — and that
 * one sentence is the whole of this component. Under {@code addMode: "many"} the option is a shape the user
 * instantiates, so "is this particular handler required" is not a question the document is answering; the
 * key is therefore <b>omitted entirely</b> rather than guessed at as {@code required}. That distinction is
 * why the result is an {@code Optional<Boolean>} and not a {@code boolean}: three states, not two.
 *
 * <p><b>Scoped per option, and an absent {@code addMode} reads as {@code subset}.</b> §5.1 moved the flag
 * off the {@code handlers} block onto each option and named {@code subset} its default, so the scoping test
 * is "this option is not {@code many}" rather than "this option says {@code subset}". Testing for the literal
 * word would drop presence from every option in the corpus that omits {@code addMode} — which is most of
 * them — and re-introduce exactly the defect the last paragraph describes.
 *
 * <table>
 *   <caption>The three states, and what each means downstream</caption>
 *   <tr><th>Document</th><th>Result</th><th>Rendered</th></tr>
 *   <tr><td>not {@code many} + {@code presence: "required"}</td><td>{@code Optional.of(false)}</td>
 *       <td>{@code // required}</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>not {@code many} + {@code presence: "optional"}</td><td>{@code Optional.of(true)}</td>
 *       <td>{@code // optional}</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>{@code many}, or no {@code presence}</td><td>{@code Optional.empty()}</td>
 *       <td>nothing</td></tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * <p>The value is inverted into <i>optionality</i> rather than carried as the spec's own word because the
 * wire key is {@code optional} — the same key, and the same polarity, that a parameter already uses. Before
 * this component the key was never emitted at all, so a mandatory handler ({@code kafka}'s
 * {@code onConsumerRecord}, {@code websub}'s {@code onEventNotification}) was indistinguishable from a
 * skippable one.
