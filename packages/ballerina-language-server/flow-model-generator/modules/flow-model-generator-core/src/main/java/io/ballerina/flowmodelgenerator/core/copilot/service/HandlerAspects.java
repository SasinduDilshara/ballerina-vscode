 * The handler tier of spec §5: everything written on one {@code remote}/{@code resource function} line

 * {@link AnnotationAspects}.
 *
 * <p>Each method runs once per handler, and each owns one construct so that a change to how a handler is
 * named cannot perturb how it is written. The recurring split is provenance: a <b>concrete</b> service
 * type's methods are read from the semantic model, so anything the compiler already reports is taken from
 * there and the document is not consulted; a <b>marker</b> type's handlers have only what the document
 * states.
 *
 * <p>Order carries no meaning in this tier — {@link HandlerDraft} holds each slot as a field and emits the
 * wire contract's key order itself.
