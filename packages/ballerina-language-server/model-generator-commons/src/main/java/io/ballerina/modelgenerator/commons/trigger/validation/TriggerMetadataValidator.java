/**
 * Runs every {@link DocumentCheck} over a {@code trigger-metadata.json} document.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this tier exists.</b> The consuming pipeline is deliberately forgiving: an unresolvable
 * annotation id is dropped with a non-fatal diagnostic, an unknown binding mode is skipped with a log
 * line, a handler naming a type the package does not declare is vetoed and the rest of the service is
 * served. Every one of those is the right behaviour at request time — a partly-broken document should
 * still yield a usable catalog — and every one of them turns a document defect into silence. This tier is
 * where that silence is broken, at the only moment it can be acted on: in a test, over the corpus this
 * repo owns.
 *
 * <p><b>What it deliberately does not do.</b> It does not validate against
 * {@code resources/schemas/trigger-metadata.schema.json} literally: no JSON-schema implementation is on
 * this build's classpath, and adding one would break every {@code --offline} build that has not already
 * cached it. That is a real gap and is recorded as one — but it is the smaller half. A JSON schema can
 * check shapes and enumerations; it cannot check that {@code params[].dataBinding} names a rule that
 * exists, that a {@code rules[].members[].handler} names a handler the service type declares, or that an
 * annotation is referenced from the slot its {@code attachPoint} allows. Those are the checks here, and
 * they are the ones that were silently failing.
 *
 * @since 1.10.0
