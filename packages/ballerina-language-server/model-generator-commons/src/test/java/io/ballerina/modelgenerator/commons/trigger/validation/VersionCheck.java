/**
 * The spec's top-level {@code version}: required, and of the form {@code v<major>.<minor>} (spec §11).
 *
 * <p><b>ERROR where {@link SpecVersionGate} only warns, and the asymmetry is the point.</b> The gate runs
 * at load time against documents this repo does not own — a connector may ship its own — so it must keep a
 * working library working. This check runs over the repo's own corpus in a test, where an omission is a
 * defect somebody can simply fix. Making both permissive would leave the key optional forever; making both
 * strict would take every trigger library offline the moment one document lagged.
 *
 * <p>That asymmetry is why the pre-release {@code "v1"} form is an ERROR here while the gate accepts it: a
 * document this repo ships has no reason to still carry it, and leaving it would mean the corpus never
 * finishes migrating.
